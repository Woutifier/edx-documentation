Coming Soon

A new, more flexible and accessible drag and drop problem type is currently under development. The new problem type will eventually replace the current drag and drop problem type for new course content, but will not affect existing drag and drop problems.


For Learners

A new Notes tool allows learners to highlight text and take notes while they progress through a course. Course teams have to enable notes in Studio advanced setting. For more information, see Notes Tool http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/notes.html#notes-tool in the Building and Running an edX Course guide, or Taking Notes in an edX Course http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_notes.html#sfd-notes in the EdX Learner’s Guide.

The edX website now includes an All Subjects page, where learners can see all the subjects that edX courses cover as well as the available courses in those subjects. (screen shot)

A new “Peer Instruction Question” heading and “Explain to other students why you chose this answer” cue for the final answer text box make ORA problems easier for learners to navigate.


For Course Teams

The Organization and Title fields are now optional for instructor biographies.


A new report for ORA assignments includes information such as each learner’s response, assessment details and scores, and learner feedback for each ORA assignment in the course. For more information, see Generate a Report for ORA Assignments in the Building and Running an edX Course guide. For more information, see Generate a Report for ORA Assignments in the Building and Running an Open edX Course guide.

Speaking of ORA, we have updated the Best Practices for Open Response Assessments http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/open_response_assessments/OpenResponseAssessments.html#best-practices-for-ora / http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/open_response_assessments/OpenResponseAssessments.html#best-practices-for-ora section of Building and Running an [Open] edX Course so that it advises course teams to include only one ORA assignment per unit in Studio.












LMS Dashboard/XSeries

The LMS dashboard now displays information about more than one XSeries for courses. If a course is part of more than one XSeries, information about each XSeries appears in the dashboard section for that course.



Documentation

The search feature for edX documentation includes two improvements.

You can now include punctuation and other non-alphanumeric characters in search terms. For example, you can search for terms such as “A/B testing” or “user_id.”
The snippet of content in search results no longer shows .. include:: for some results. Those search results now show a sample of the actual documentation content in the results.


Open edX

CourseTalk for Course Reviews
Installations running the latest version of Open edX can now add the CourseTalk widget to their instances of Open edX. The CourseTalk widget allows learners to post course ratings and reviews that then appear on the course’s About page. When you add the CourseTalk widget to an Open edX instance, the widget is enabled for every course on that instance.

For installations running the latest version of Open edX, this release includes updates to the user interface on the Checkout page that is presented by the the edX e-commerce service. The functionality of this page has not changed, and learners can continue to check out using their credit cards or PayPal.

For more information about the edX e-commerce service, see Adding E-Commerce to the Open edX Platform in the Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform guide.

A new section, “Adding E-Commerce to the Open edX Platform”, is now available in the Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform guide. Two versions of this guide are available on the docs.edx.org website.

Installations running the Dogwood version of Open edX can refer to Adding E-Commerce to the Open edX Platform (Dogwood) in the Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform - Dogwood Release guide. http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-installing-configuring-and-running/en/named-release-dogwood.rc/ecommerce/index.html

The LMS now supports internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of static user interface text in XBlocks. You use the GNU gettext Portable Object (PO) file format to provide translated text strings for an XBlock’s “chrome” or “labels”. For more information, see EdX Learning Management System as an XBlock Runtime http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/xblock-tutorial/en/latest/edx_platform/edx_lms.html#edx-learning-management-system-as-an-xblock-runtime in the Open edX XBlock Tutorial.

* The JavaScript library Underscore.js has been upgraded to version 1.8.3.

Documentation for Open edX Users
Some sections of the Open EdX Developer’s Guide have been reorganized. The “Writing Good Code” section now includes a new subsection, Preventing Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities, as well as existing subsections edX Accessibility Guidelines, Internationalization Coding Guidelines, and Django Good Practices. If you have bookmarked existing pages in this guide, you should visit the updated version to locate and re-bookmark pages in the new structure.

The Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform guide has been reorganized. Improvements include a streamlined table of contents which combines various “installing” and “configuring” sections for developer stack and full stack options under two new top level sections: Installing and Starting the Open edX Platform and Configuring the Open edX Platform. If you have bookmarked existing pages in this guide, you should visit the updated version to locate and re-bookmark pages in the new structure.

The Building and Running an Open edX Course guide now includes the same Glossary that is included in the Building and Running an edX Course guide.




New Drag and Drop Problem Type
A new drag and drop problem type is currently under development. The new drag and drop problem type is much easier to create, is more flexible and accessible, and works on mobile devices. The new problem type will eventually replace the current drag and drop problem type for new course content. The new drag and drop problem type will not affect existing courses that include drag and drop problems created using the older problem type.

This release includes several updates to the user interface for peer instruction problems. These updates include a change to the problem heading, which now reads “Peer Instruction Question”, and the addition of an “Explain to other students why you chose this answer” cue for the final answer text box.

A note has been added to alert course teams to a best practice for using open response (ORA) assignments. Each course unit must contain only one ORA assignment. Multiple ORA assignments in a unit cause errors when learners submit peer assessments.

For more information, see Best Practices for Open Response Assessments http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/open_response_assessments/OpenResponseAssessments.html#best-practices-for-ora in the Building and Running an edX Course guide or Best Practices for Open Response Assessments http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/exercises_tools/open_response_assessments/OpenResponseAssessments.html#best-practices-for-ora in the Building and Running an Open edX Course guide.
