Drag and Drop Problem
##########################

In drag and drop problems, learners respond to a question by dragging text or
objects to a specific location on an image. This section explains how to use
drag and drop problems in your course.

.. note:
    This drag and drop problem type is intended as a replacement for an older
    drag and drop problem type. This drag and drop problem type includes
    significant improvements and you should use it for any new course
    development. For more information about the previous, deprecated drag and
    drop problem type, see :ref:`Drag and Drop`.

*********************************
Overview
*********************************

A drag and drop problem includes a background image and one or more draggable
images that learners move into target zones on the background image. You can
include as many draggable items and as many target zones as you need. You can
include decoy items that do not have a target and you can include decoy targets
that do not correspond to draggable items.

Learners drag items from the top section of the drag and drop problem on to the
background image. The way that a learner selects, or grabs, an item depends on
the type of browser that that learner uses. For example, a learner might click
and hold on a draggable item with a mouse pointer to select it, drag the item
to a target, and release the mouse pointer to drop the item on the target. The
drag and drop problem type supports mobile device interfaces. If a learner
requires or prefers a keyboard interface, the drag and drop problem type
supports selecting items and their matching target zones with standard keyboard
navigation keys.

Learners will receive full credit for a drag and drop problem when all items
that have matching zones have been dragged to those zones. Drag and drop
problems do not support partial credit.

The following image shows an example drag and drop problem.

      problem, such as its title, text, and introductory feedback are labeled.

The following image shows the success feedback message that learners see when
they match a draggable item with its target zone. Each draggable item has its
own success feedback message.

      message appears above the background image.

The following image shows the error feedback message that learners see when
they match a draggable item with an incorrect target zone. Each draggable item
has its own error feedback message.

      message appears over the background image.

The following image shows a completed drag and drop problem. The final feedback
message informs the learner that the problem is complete.

      and the final feedback message appears below the background image.


===============================
Understanding Background Images
===============================

The background image for a drag and drop problem is the surface that learners drag items onto.

A target zone is a rectangular area on the background image. You can display or
hide the borders of a zone for learners. You can add labels for zones or leave
them unlabeled.

==============================
Understanding Draggable Items
==============================

A draggable item is a rectangle that contains either a label or an image. Learners will grab droppable items from the top of a drag and drop problem and drag them to targets on the background image.

The size of the rectangle depends on the amount or text in the label or the
size of the image. You can set the background color and the label text color
for the items in a problem.

Each draggable item can match one target zone on the background image. Draggable items
